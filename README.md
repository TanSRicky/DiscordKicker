# DiscordKicker
Script that uses psutil to keep Discord processes at low priority to avoid performance loss in video games.
  
Current state:
  1. The program runs from the terminal
  2. The program succesfully finds process and attempts to lower priority. May fail based on User Account Control
  3. Works for Windows only
  
TODO:
  1. Make program more robust
  2. Add list to choose from
  3. Take the program from terminal to Tkinter
